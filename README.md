## Breadth First Search

Applications:

1. Shortest Path and Minimum spanning tree for unweighted graph
2. Peer-to-Peer networks (finding peer nodes)
3. Crawlers -> you can limit the depth that you crawl to
4. Social Networking websites (friends to nth degree)

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space: O(v) (if you store all verticies in the queue)
